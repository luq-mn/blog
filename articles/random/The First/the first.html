        <h2>My first article?</h2>
        <p>
            Okay, my first article. It was a Thursday. I spent the night earlier with my dear friend Ameer on a voice call
            where we did our typical late night activities - but last night was different.
            Of course I felt a little drowsy throughout the morning, but it faded as I approach 9 am.
            The weather was splendid, somewhat clear skies with a nice morning breeze and a bit of sunshine.
            Today was not really going according to my typical routine, I showered, and slept extremely late.
            I still spent a few moments of my morning to read through the news, and watch a teaspoon of Bloomberg.
        </p>

        <p>
            Regarding the teaspoon of news I got from Bloomberg -  there were a report citing that the White House is considering on further restricting the sale of
            advanced chips to China, which brought the S&P 500 to have its most significant drop since late 2023. There was
            also talks about how Trump wants Taiwan to pay for US military protection. All major semiconductor stocks fell, with
            the exception of Intel and Global Foundries.
